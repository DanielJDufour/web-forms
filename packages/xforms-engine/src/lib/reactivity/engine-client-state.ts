 *
 * - It may execute more frequently than desired (i.e. it has no special
 *   behavior for batching) This is mitigated with an equality check to avoid
 *   repeatedly/excessively propagating identical state values to a client.
 *
 * - It may someday be removed from Solid's public API; Solid's creator has
 *   repeatedly expressed wanting to make this change. It's unlikely we can
 *   mitigate this, but we can observe that it would likely have already been
 *   removed if it didn't serve necessary end-user use cases. And we can be
